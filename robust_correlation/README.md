Bayesian robust correlation with Stan in R
==========================================

This folder contains: 

* A Stan Bayesian model for robust correlation (__robust_correlation.stan__)
* A function to run the model from R using the rstan package (__rob.cor.mcmc.R__)

This model is based on __Rasmus Bååth__'s robust correlation model, see:

Thanks are due to __Aki Vehtari__ for providing invaluable advice on how to improve this model.
