Bayesian robust correlation with Stan in R
==========================================

This folder contains: 

* A Stan Bayesian model for robust correlation (__robust_correlation.stan__)
* A function to run the model from R using the rstan package (__rob.cor.mcmc.R__)
* A tutorial explaining how to use the model, and explaining the advantages of Bayesian correlation and Bayesian methods in general (__robust_correlation.html__, __robust_correlation.Rmd__)

This model is based on __Rasmus Bååth__'s robust correlation model, see:
