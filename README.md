Bayesian models for data analysis
=================================

Each folder in this repository contains a Bayesian model designed for a particular kind of analysis. 
The models are written in the Stan programming language, and each is provided together with a wrapper
function for performing MCMC sampling in R using the `rstan` package, and an HTML/Rmd tutorial.
